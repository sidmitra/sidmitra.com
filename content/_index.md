I'm a freelance engineer interested in startups, with extensive experience in designing, building and maintaining web applications. Previously, I ran a successful web development studio, [Cloudshuffle](http://www.cloudshuffle.com), which is currently on hiatus.

I'm currently interested in researching *Software Complexity and related metrics*; while attempting to overcome the *imposter syndrome*.

I'm pretty big on learning languages through immersion techniques. I know Spanish(apart from Hindi, English ofcourse), and currently struggling through Mandarin(Taiwan), with the aim to learn the five most spoken languages in the world. The hope is that i could, in theory, communicate with billions of people in the world.
