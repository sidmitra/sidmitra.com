I'm a freelance engineer interested in startups, with extensive experience in designing, building and maintaining web applications. Previously, I ran a successful web development studio, [Cloudshuffle](http://www.cloudshuffle.com), which is currently on hiatus.

I'm currently interested in research Software complexity and related metrics; while attempting to overcome the *imposter syndrome*.

I'm pretty big on learning languages through immersion techniques. I know Spanish, and currently struggling through Mandarin(Taiwan), with the aim to learn the 5 most spoken languages in the world. The hope is that i couldm, in theory, communicate with billions of people in the world.
