I'm a freelance engineer interested in startups, with extensive experience in designing, building and maintaining web applications.

I used to run a successful web dev studio called [Cloudshuffle](http://www.cloudshuffle.com), which is currently on hiatus.

I'm pretty big on learning languages through immersion techniques. I know Spanish, and currently struggling through Mandarin(Taiwan), with the aim to learn the 5 most spoken languages in the world, so I could in theory communicate with billions of people in the world.
