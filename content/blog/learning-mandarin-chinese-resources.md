Language Exchange

- HelloChinese (Android)

- ChineseSkill(Collection of apps)



- There are a lot of apps, but serve different needs. It's difficult to find and formulate a study plan.
- Creating small daily habits

- Reading
  -- Duolingo style, basic grammar lessons.
  -- Vocabulary like memrise.
  -- Simpler News articles to read. Like Nulu.

- Listening
  -- Small daily news items, also read with a native tongue.
  -- Clips from podcasts, links to podcasts with small quizes.

- Speaking
  -- Audio tests like ChineseSkill.
  -- At some point i want to connect existing users with similar skill levels to google hangout together.
  -- Can also record audio with members/teachers feedback.

- Writing
  This one is difficult. Maybe starting with
  -- Quizes like re-arranging jumbled sentences
  -- English to Language translation.
