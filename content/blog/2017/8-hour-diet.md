## What is it?
It's a popular weight loss plan. The basic idea is to choose an 8 hour window to ingest all your calories and then fast for 16 hours.
Outside of your 8 hour window, you're allowed to drink low calorie beverage like Coffee(without milk), tea. There technically are no restrictions on what you eat within your eating window. The inherent assumption is that you will obviously not over-eat in that period. The restricted eating window, could in theory automatically restrict your intake of calories and also the fasting period supposedly has a positive impact on your metabolism.


## Why am i doing it?
I actually came across this idea while reading up on [intermittent fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) and it's effect on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and Diabetes.
On my last visit to a doctor, he told me some of my skin issues might be related to a pre-diabetic condition. So i've been meaning to control my ingestion of sugar and calories in general. I've tried out calorie tracking with MyFitnessPal, but never managed to make it stick.


## What is my plan?
- 3 days a week.
- Eat during 10am to 6pm
- Fast from 6pm to 10am next day, total of 16 hours.

### How'd it go?
## Week 1
26 Apr 2017 (Wednesday)
I decided to stop eating anything at 6pm, and only water after wards. For a 16 hour fasting cycle, it means you can't eat until 10am next day. I get hungry around 6-7pm, but i decided to start with this time anyway since those are normal work hours. That i guess would make it easier, eat during work hours, fast during others.

The first day was surprisingly easy, perhaps because i was motivated enough starting out. Even though i saw others eat, I powered through it easily. The next morning i ate at around 10.30am. So it was slightly more than 16 hours and i felt reasonably good. Although i gorged on this bacon flavoured cheese snack which I do not think was a good idea.

27 Apr 2017 (Thursday) - The second day was difficult. I had this burning sensation in my stomach which i attribute to hunger. So i decided to have a sip of water every few minutes. I ended up going to the bathroom a lot to pee. After a couple of hours of that, i just decided to drink half a litre of water together. That kinda filled my stomach enough to not feel that bad. Next morning woke up late so had a Chocochino(from my Dolce Gusto machine). I also had a slice of goat cheese(although i don't really like it). It didn't stop me from eating a lot.

The third day was a Friday. I had to travel over the long weekend so i decided to continue again on Tuesday.

So i only could manage 2 out of my 3 days per week i decided. It did take a lot of focus to continue working and ignore the hunger in the evening on the last day.

TODO: Describe schedule
Wake up Morning coffee + something(maybe fruit some snack).
Lunch at 2
After lunch coffee/milk
Evening snack - Maybe dried plums
After 6 nothing

## Week 2
Tuesday - Stopped eating at 6.

Did 2 days

## Week 3
Decided to try out 5 days a week, only managed 3.

## Week 4
Going to try out 5 days a week.
Monday (15 May 2017) -
Accidententaly ate some candy. So considering 7pm the start
There's only so much you can eat within 8 hours
May 17 - Tried but failed. Went out to eat, pastry and coffee.
May 18 - Was really hungry so failed. Ate some Chocolate and garbanzo.
Days is going to be too much especially with work, so decided to stick to 3.
weight: 87.7Kg

## Second go - Five days a week.

## What did you learn?
- 16 hours is enough
- Quick hack. Sleep till late to avoid morning hunger.
- Fill up on water.
- Hunger is a feeling. It's all in the brain hypothalamus*.
- Mornings are easier, than late nights.
- With work stress it can be difficult to maintain focus on this and work
- Set alarm/timer for fasting(don't need fancy apps, havent found a good one for me yet). Likely to forget the time in a few weeks.
- Track using coach.me or any other habit tracking app.
- After just two weeks it felt better.
- Sometimes Adjusted time to 4pm to 8am in the morning so i could have coffee during my morning office/calls
- Any impact on weight? First time Didn't track weight, was a mistake.

- Some days ate something between 6pm. Extended fast to 11pm next day.
- Check-off early for today(and not next day 10am). Hack. Its hard to take off the checkmark than to put it.

## What were the results.
