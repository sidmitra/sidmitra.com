## What is it?
It's a popular weight loss plan. The basic idea is to choose an 8 hour window to ingest all your calories and then fast for 16 hours.
Outside of your 8 hour window, you are allowed to drink low calorie beverage like Coffee(without milk), tea. There technically are no restrictions on what you eat within your eating window. The inherent assumption is that you will obviously not over-eat in that period. The restricted eating window, could in theory automatically restrict your intake of calories and also the fasting period supposedly has a positive impact on your metabolism.
There are various forms of this with different fasting windows like 12, 18 hours. But from what I read 16 hours

## Why am I doing it?
I actually came across this idea while reading up on [**intermittent fasting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) and it's effect on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and Diabetes.
On my last visit to a doctor, he told me some of my skin issues might be related to a pre-diabetic condition. So i've been meaning to control my ingestion of sugar and calories in general. I've tried out calorie tracking with MyFitnessPal, but never managed to make it stick.

## What is my plan
- Eat during 10am to 6pm
- Fast from 6pm to 10am next day, total of 16 hours.

## First trial - 3 Days a week
I decided to start off fairly easy with only doing the diet 3 days a week and then gradually increasing to 5 maybe the whole week.
Little did i know that it was going to be a difficult ride.

- The first day was easy, but it gets harder to continue on later in the week. This was probably because the motivation is the highest on the first day and harder to maintain each passing day.
- Initially some days I would just forget that my fasting window had started and I would eat some random thing like candies. So I didn't continue my fast on those days.
- At nights I would get really hungry and unable to focus on work. I just relented on a lot of days and just ate something.
- I wasn't tracking my weight every day so there was no visible metric that was motivating me. I still did track my weight randomly at random times and tracked it on Google Fit app. But I didn't see enough of a trend.
- On some mornings also I forgot that my 16 hour window wasn't done yet and I'd have some coffee with milk, breaking my fast and making it not count.
- On Fridays we had a habit of ordering in food(sushi, pizza) or buying some snacks and watching Netflix. So breaking that habit was a bit hard, and I would sometimes defer my fast to Saturday instead of Friday. But that never worked out, once you already relented it was hard to be stronger the next day.
- If everyone else is eating dinner around you, it was extremely hard to not give in.
- I work as a freelancer, so work at nights on most days. With a lot going on with projects, it was harder to maintain focus on the diet.

Here's my log of the days I completed the diet successfully from April to August:

As you can see I failed to get into a regular pattern and missed out on a lot of days. I gave up in September and decided to quit.
I did think that the diet had some merit, but I needed to figure out some changes to make it stick. It was entirely my fault and lack of motivation to not be able to continue on. I decided to try again in the future.

## Second trial - 5 days a week.

## Third Trial
Can do easily Mon-Wed. Thursday i usually end up breaking the cycle, probably more due to boredom.
Was sleeping more in the mornings and working later at night to make up.


## What did you learn?
- 16 hours is enough
- Quick hack. Sleep till late to avoid morning hunger.
- Fill up on water.
- Hunger is a feeling. It's all in the brain hypothalamus*.
- Mornings are easier, than late nights.
- With work stress it can be difficult to maintain focus on this and work
- Set alarm/timer for fasting(don't need fancy apps, havent found a good one for me yet). Likely to forget the time in a few weeks.
- Track using coach.me or any other habit tracking app.
- After just two weeks it felt better.
- Sometimes Adjusted time to 4pm to 8am in the morning so i could have coffee during my morning office/calls
- Any impact on weight? First time Didn't track weight, was a mistake.
- Some level of family support needed, until you make a habit of it.

- Some days ate something between 6pm. Extended fast to 11pm next day.
- Check-off early for today(and not next day 10am). Hack. Its hard to take off the checkmark than to put it.
- Sparkling water.


## What were the results.
- Weight loss
- Not as hungry
- Intake of sugar/pastries less.
- Water intake more
