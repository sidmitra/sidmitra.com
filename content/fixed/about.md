I'm a freelance developer and entrepreneur interested in startups, with considerable experience in designing, building and maintaining web applications.


I'm pretty big on learning languages through immersion. I know Spanish, and currently struggling through Mandarin(Taiwan), with the aim to learn the 5 most spoken languages in the world, so I could in theory communicate with billions of people in the world.
