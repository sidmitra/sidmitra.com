I'm a freelance developer and entrepreneur interested in startups, with considerable experience in designing, building and maintaining web applications, mobile apps.
I currently run a digital studio called [Cloudshuffle](http://www.cloudshuffle.com) that helps startups build web and mobile apps and scale their business. We work with a lot of awesome startups, so check us out.


I like to travel, and learn new languages. I know Spanish, and am currently learning Mandarin(Taiwan). I aim to learn atleast the 5 most spoken languages in the world, so i could in theory communicate with billions of people in the world.
